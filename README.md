# Why use a Floating Action Menu (FAM)
FAMs optimize interfaces by organizing related functionalities into a compact, easily accessible format. They simplify navigation, reduce clutter, and maintain a sleek interface while offering quick access to a range of secondary functions. FAMs contribute to a visually appealing design and enhance user experience by providing a streamlined way to access essential and related actions within an app.
